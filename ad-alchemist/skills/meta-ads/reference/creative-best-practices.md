# Creative Best Practices Reference

## The Creative-First Mindset

> "In 2026, creative is the #1 lever for Meta ads performance. Your creative determines who sees your ad, how much you pay, and whether people convert."

### Why Creative Matters More Than Ever

1. **Andromeda algorithm** uses creative signals for targeting
2. **Broad audiences** mean creative must self-select viewers
3. **Creative diversity** beats single "hero" ad approach
4. **UGC and lo-fi** outperform polished content

## The Hook: First 3 Seconds / 125 Characters

### Why Hooks Matter

- Users scroll fast - you have ~1.5 seconds to stop them
- First 125 characters show before "See more"
- Video hooks must grab in first 3 seconds
- Hook rate correlates directly with overall performance

### Hook Formulas

**Pattern Interrupt**
```
"I need to show you something weird..."
"This shouldn't work, but it does."
"Delete this video if you're not [target audience]"
```

**Call Out Audience**
```
"Hey [specific audience], this is for you."
"If you're a [job title] who struggles with [problem]..."
"Every [audience] needs to see this."
```

**Bold Claim**
```
"This [product] made me $X in [time]."
"I found the secret to [desired outcome]."
"[Brand] doesn't want you to know this."
```

**Question Hook**
```
"What if [desired outcome] was actually easy?"
"Have you ever wondered why [common frustration]?"
"Want to know the #1 mistake [audience] makes?"
```

**Story Open**
```
"I was [relatable situation] until..."
"Last week, something crazy happened."
"I used to think [common belief], then..."
```

**Controversy/Hot Take**
```
"Unpopular opinion: [contrarian view]"
"[Industry] has been lying to you."
"Stop doing [common practice] immediately."
```

### Hook Writing Tips

1. **Be specific**: "Lose 10 lbs" beats "Lose weight"
2. **Use numbers**: Specific numbers feel more credible
3. **Create curiosity**: Leave something unsaid
4. **Match the audience**: Speak their language
5. **Test constantly**: Hooks are your biggest lever

## Headlines

### Headline Framework (5-7 Words)

Headlines appear below the creative. They should:
- Reinforce the main message
- Include a benefit
- Be scannable

### Headline Formulas

**Direct Benefit**
```
"Get [Benefit] in [Timeframe]"
"Finally, [Desired Outcome] Made Easy"
"The [Adjective] Way to [Benefit]"
```

**Social Proof**
```
"Join [Number]+ Happy Customers"
"Rated #1 by [Authority]"
"[Number] People Can't Be Wrong"
```

**Problem-Solution**
```
"Stop [Pain]. Start [Benefit]."
"End [Problem] Forever"
"Say Goodbye to [Pain Point]"
```

**Urgency**
```
"Limited Time: [Offer]"
"Only [Number] Left"
"Ends [Day/Time]"
```

**Question**
```
"Ready for [Benefit]?"
"Tired of [Pain Point]?"
"What If [Desired Outcome]?"
```

## Primary Text (Body Copy)

### Structure Template

```
[HOOK - 125 characters max, create curiosity]

[BODY - 2-3 short paragraphs or bullet points]
• Benefit 1 - most important
• Benefit 2 - supports first
• Benefit 3 - differentiator

[SOCIAL PROOF - optional but powerful]
"[Quote from customer]" - Name

[CTA - clear next step]
Click below to [specific action] →
```

### Primary Text Tips

1. **Front-load value**: Best content in first 125 chars
2. **Use line breaks**: Walls of text don't get read
3. **Bullet points**: Easy to scan
4. **Emoji sparingly**: 1-2 max, don't overdo it
5. **CTA at end**: Tell them exactly what to do

### Length Guidelines

| Format | Recommended Length |
|--------|-------------------|
| Feed ads | 125-250 characters |
| Story/Reels | Minimal (10-50 chars) |
| Lead gen | 150-300 characters |
| Retargeting | 100-200 characters |

## Visual Creative

### Format Specifications

| Placement | Aspect Ratio | Resolution |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Feed | 4:5 (portrait) | 1080 x 1350 |
| Feed | 1:1 (square) | 1080 x 1080 |
| Stories/Reels | 9:16 | 1080 x 1920 |
| Carousel | 1:1 | 1080 x 1080 |

### Video Specifications

- **Length**: 15-30 seconds (sweet spot)
- **Hook**: Within first 3 seconds
- **Sound**: Design for sound-off (captions!)
- **CTA**: Clear ending action
- **Loop**: Consider for short videos

### UGC (User-Generated Content) Style

**Why UGC works**:
- Feels native to platform
- Builds trust (real people)
- Higher engagement rates
- Lower production cost

**UGC Elements**:
```
✓ Selfie-style camera angle
✓ Natural lighting
✓ Authentic, unscripted feel
✓ Phone-quality (not too polished)
✓ Person talking directly to camera
✓ Real locations (home, office, outside)
```

**UGC Structure**:
```
0-3s: Hook (pattern interrupt)
3-10s: Problem identification
10-20s: Solution/product introduction
20-25s: Results/benefits
25-30s: CTA
```

### Lo-Fi vs Polished

| Lo-Fi (Native) | Polished (Brand) |
|----------------|------------------|
| UGC testimonials | Brand campaigns |
| Product demos | Product launches |
| Behind-the-scenes | Seasonal campaigns |
| Quick tips | Awareness |
| Retargeting | Upper funnel |

**Recommendation**: Test both, but start with lo-fi for direct response.

## Ad Families Concept

### What Are Ad Families?

Group of ads that share a concept but vary in execution:

```
Ad Family: "Customer Story"
├── Video: 30-second testimonial
├── Static: Quote + customer photo
├── Carousel: Before/after journey
└── Reels: Quick 15-second clip

Same message, different formats/lengths
```

### Why Ad Families Work

1. **Algorithm diversity**: More options for Meta to test
2. **Placement coverage**: Right format for each placement
3. **Creative testing**: Identify winning concepts, not just formats
4. **Reduced fatigue**: Multiple versions of winning idea

## Creative Testing Framework

### Testing Hierarchy

Test in this order:
1. **Concepts** (biggest impact): What's the main message?
2. **Hooks** (high impact): First 3 seconds/125 chars
3. **Formats** (medium impact): Video vs static vs carousel
4. **Copy variations** (lower impact): Headlines, body text

### Testing Structure

```
Campaign: Creative Testing
└── Ad Set: Broad Audience (same across all)
    ├── Ad: Concept A - Hook 1
    ├── Ad: Concept A - Hook 2
    ├── Ad: Concept B - Hook 1
    └── Ad: Concept B - Hook 2

Let Meta find winner, then iterate on winning concept
```

### Statistical Significance

Before declaring a winner:
- 50+ conversions per variation (ideal)
- 20+ conversions minimum
- 3-7 days of data
- Consistent performance trend

## Creative Refresh Cycles

### When to Refresh

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Frequency > 3 | Start planning refresh |
| CTR declining 20%+ | Refresh immediately |
| 3-4 weeks running | Proactive refresh |
| CPA climbing steadily | Test new creative |

### Refresh Strategy

1. **Keep winners running**: Don't pause what works
2. **Add new variations**: Test alongside winners
3. **Iterate on concepts**: New hooks for winning ideas
4. **Kill underperformers**: Pause clear losers after 7 days

## Creative for Each Funnel Stage

- Brand introduction
- Problem awareness

### MOFU (Consideration)

- Product details
- Social proof
- Comparisons

- Customer stories

### BOFU (Conversion)

- Clear CTA
